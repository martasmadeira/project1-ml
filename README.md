# 02452 Project 1 – Fall 2025

## Project Description

This project applies methods learned in the "Data: Feature Extraction and Visualization" section of the course to a dataset of your choice. The aim is to gain a basic understanding of the dataset prior to further analysis in Project 2.

As a new "employee," your task is to create a useful description of the dataset for your co-workers, including basic visualizations and insights.

---

## Objective

- Understand your dataset thoroughly.
- Apply exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques including summary statistics and visualizations.
- Address data issues such as missing values, extreme values, or outliers.
- Prepare for future machine learning tasks: classification and regression.
- Apply PCA analysis to visualize principal components and variance explained.

---

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Provide the source of your dataset]
- **Description:** [Brief description of the dataset and its attributes]

---

## Deliverables

1. **Written report** (PDF, max 10 pages, including figures and tables)
   - Clear introduction and overview of the dataset
   - Summary of attributes and data issues
   - Data visualizations following ACCENT principles and Tufte’s guidelines
   - PCA analysis:
     - Principal directions of components
     - Variance explained vs. number of components
     - 2D projections of data on principal components
   - Discussion summarizing key insights
2. **Code archive** (.zip containing Python, R, or MATLAB scripts used)
   - Code is not graded but used to validate results
   - Data files should **not** be included

   - Potential preprocessing (centering, standardization, log transform, etc.)
2. **Attribute Analysis**
   - Attribute types (discrete/continuous, nominal/ordinal/interval/ratio)
   - Data issues and handling
   - Summary statistics
3. **Data Visualizations**
   - Check for outliers or extreme values
   - Attribute distributions
   - Correlations
4. **PCA Analysis**
   - Principal component directions
   - Variance explained
   - 2D projections with color coding by target attribute
5. **Discussion**
   - Key findings and insights
   - Feasibility of main machine learning aim
